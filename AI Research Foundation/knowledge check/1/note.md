`As mentioned in the article The Power of Language Models, the Oxford English Dictionary has entries for around one million words. Assume that there are actually exactly one million entries: 700,000 entries refer to common words (e.g., house) and 300,000 refer to scientific terms (e.g., photosynthesis). If all common words have exactly the same probability and all scientific terms have the same probability, and the probability of each common word is 5 times as high as the probability of each scientific word, what are the probabilities of “hungry” (a common word) and “photosynthesis” (a scientific term)?`

>probability of common words = 5 * probability of scientific term

>1= (Number fo common words * (5*probability of common words))+(Number fo scientific term * probability of scientific term)

1 = (700,000 * (5Ps))+(300,000 * Ps)

1 = (3,500,000 * Ps) + (300,000 * Ps)

1 = 3,800,000 * Ps

Ps = 1 / 3,800,00 => 0.000000263157

Pc = 5 * (1/3,800,000) => 0.000001315789
